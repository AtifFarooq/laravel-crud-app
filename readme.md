## About the project

This is a basic web-app/'blog' that offers simple CRUD functionality. It was built for educational purposes using PHP/Laravel and MySQL. It uses 'Blade' for templating.

Here, we can see the 'home' page:

Similarly, this page displays the 'posts' page:

This app is based on Brad Traversy's example, and I did it to better understand PHP/Laravel.
